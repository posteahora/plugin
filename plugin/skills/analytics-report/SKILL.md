# Analytics report → PosteAhora

Use this when the user wants to understand performance. This skill is **read-only**
for metrics — it never publishes.

## Steps
1. Call **`get_analytics`**. Choose the window from the user's ask:
   `period` = `7d` | `30d` (default) | `90d` | `all`. Pass a `platform` filter only
   if the user asked about one network.
2. Summarize the returned data:
   - **Headline totals** — views, likes, comments, shares (from `summary.totals`).
   - **Per-platform breakdown** — which network is pulling weight
     (`summary.byPlatform`).
   - **Top posts** — rank `posts` by engagement (likes + comments + shares, or
     `totalInteractions`) and show the best few with their captions.
3. Offer a takeaway: what format/topic/platform is working, and what to double down
   on. Keep it concrete and tied to the numbers.
4. **Optionally**, if the user wants to act on it, offer to add follow-up ideas to
   their board with `create_idea` (that's the `collect-post-ideas` flow) — ask
   before creating anything.

## Guardrails
- Read-only: never call `create_post`, `schedule_post`, or `publish_post_now` here.
- Never invent numbers. Report only what `get_analytics` returns.
- If a metric is `null`, say the platform doesn't report it — don't show it as `0`.
- Metrics refresh hourly, so very recent posts may show little or no data yet — say
  so rather than implying they underperformed.
